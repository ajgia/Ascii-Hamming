Assignment 2 Hamming-to-ASCII Documentation

Programs:
main_to_hamming - Translates ASCII input to Hamming code
main_to_ascii - Translates Hamming input to ASCII

Functionality:
main_to_hamming will read lines of input from STD_IN and write the hamming code to 12 files 
main_to_ascii will read the 12 files, decode the hamming code, perform any error correction, and write the resulting ASCII to STD_OUT

Hamming protocol:
Hamming 12 8
8 data bits for a word of 12 bits
Internally, bits are labeled in positions 1-12 (1-indexed)
Parity bits are in positions 1, 2, 4, 8
Bit 1 parity checks Bits in posiitons 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 -> Check 2^0 bits, skip 2^0 bits, etc
Bit 2 parity checks bits in positions 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11 -> Check 2^1 bits, skip 2^1 bits, etc
Bit 4 parity checks bits in positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 12 -> Check 2^2 bits, skip 2^2 bits, etc
Bit 8 parity checks bits in positions 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 -> Check 2^3 bits, skip 2^3 bits, etc
Parity check adds bits and sets the parity bit to get an even or odd result.
